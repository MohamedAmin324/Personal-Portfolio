# Tech Stack
- React
- Increase the potential of the react app using libraries: Lodash
- Handle email functionality: Email.JS
- React Router
- React Redux (if necessary)
- TypeScript Note: This project will be implemented using JavaScript, migrating to TypeScript will come in future updates
- CSS framework: Bootstrap CSS along with SCSS for necessary customizations
- Build tool: Vite.js
- Deployment platform: Netlify
- Implementing Animation is not a top priority right now: potential libraries: GSAP or Motion


# Responsive Layout:
- Mobile First approach


# Notes about the general layout:
- The sections i want to implement: About me(Home page, still not sure about including image), Skills, Contact, Projects, Resume
- Toggle Dark mode on/off
- Removing the following Parts from the template:
   - Search functionality
   - The animation of skills in the Home page


# Note about Accessibility
Implementation of accessibility will be limited but further enhanced in the future, refer back to the corresponding Notion section

## About Me Section:
The icons used in the navigation bar are from this [website](https://www.svgrepo.com/vectors/github/)




## Projects Section
This section will essentially have 4 projects, each with its own description , title , tech stack and links to live preview & github
You can later add a link to a website fully dedicated to showing all the projects with category and search functionality


# General Notes:
- **Adding Potential Easter Eggs**
- Add a reference to the website and design
- All the icons used must be suitable for both dark and light mode (this may require using one for each mode)
- Add the following social media icons:
    - Github
    - Linkedin
    - CodePen: not now but after I rework my profile and add some good work in it
    - DEV Community: not now (maybe after I get to write some articles there)
    - Instagram, Facebook, YouTube & Twitter: if I am able to create something relevant
